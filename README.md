## Additional features
- funny Super Mario melodies are played on startup and begin/end of brewing
- brewing progress is indicated by the LEDs
- two additional brewing times are selectable
- **last used brewing time is persisted and restored after device restart**

## Please note
This software is not working out-of-the-box with the original Teeodohr. It is designed for the elcombri version which has a slightly different circuit.

Please see the branch `original-hardware` of this repository for a version that runs on the original Teeodohr circuit board.
