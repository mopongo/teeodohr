## Additional features
- funny Super Mario melodies are played on startup and begin/end of brewing
- brewing progress is indicated by the LEDs
- two additional brewing times are selectable
- **last used brewing time is persisted and restored after device restart**

## Works with the original hardware
This software variant is working out-of-the-box with the original Teeodohr circuit board. No modifications are necessary.

Note: Users of the elcombri version of Teeodohr will find the appropriate software on the `master` branch of this repository.
